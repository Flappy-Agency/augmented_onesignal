# augmented_onesignal

A **Flutter federated plugin** providing a unified, platform-agnostic API for OneSignal push notifications.

Supports:

- ‚úÖ Android
- ‚úÖ iOS
- ‚úÖ Web

## Features

- Initialize OneSignal with your app ID
- Request push permission
- Listen for permission changes
- Stream foreground and click notification events
- Manage tags and user login
- Manage user email

## Getting started

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  augmented_onesignal: ^<latest-version>
```

## üß≠ Basic Usage
```dart
import 'package:augmented_onesignal/augmented_onesignal.dart';

await AugmentedOneSignal.init(apiKey: '<YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID>');
await AugmentedOneSignal.requestPushPermission();

AugmentedOneSignal.permissionChangeStream().listen((hasPermission) {
  // React to permission changes
});

AugmentedOneSignal.foregroundNotificationStream.listen((notification) {
  // Handle notification while app is in foreground
});

AugmentedOneSignal.clickNotificationStream.listen((notification) {
  // Handle notification click
});
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Platform-specific setup

### ‚úÖ Android & iOS

‚Ä¢	Make sure you follow OneSignal‚Äôs official setup guide for native configuration.
‚Ä¢	Our plugin augments the existing OneSignal Flutter SDK but requires that your project is correctly set up with:
‚Ä¢	Correct app ID
‚Ä¢	Firebase Cloud Messaging
‚Ä¢	iOS capabilities (Push Notifications, Background Modes)

### ‚úÖ Web Setup

To use OneSignal Web Push with this plugin.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Import OneSignal SDK in web/index.html

```html
<script src="https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDK.page.js" async></script>
<script>
    window.OneSignalDeferred = window.OneSignalDeferred || [];
</script>
```

‚úÖ Explanation:
‚Ä¢	The first script loads the OneSignal Web SDK.
‚Ä¢	The second script initializes OneSignalDeferred, which is required for our plugin to queue calls before OneSignal finishes loading.

Without these lines, Web support will not work correctly.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Include the Service Worker

To enable push notifications on Web, OneSignal requires a Service Worker.

‚úÖ Add OneSignal‚Äôs Service Worker to your project

```agsl
web/
  index.html
  onesignal/
    OneSignalSDKWorker.js
```

Make sure the `OneSignalSDKWorker.js` file is located in the `web/onesignal/` directory.
Here is the content of the `OneSignalSDKWorker.js` file:

```javascript
importScripts("https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDK.sw.js");
```

## üìå Notes
‚Ä¢	On Android and iOS, this plugin uses the official onesignal_flutter package under the hood.
‚Ä¢	On Web, it directly wraps the OneSignal JavaScript SDK using Dart‚Äôs JS interop.
